// Repository is the Dispatcher's own view of outbox_events — reading due
// work and recording what happened to it. Enqueueing a new event is
// deliberately not here: that happens inside whichever use-case's own
// transaction produced the event (usecase/order declares its own narrow
// Enqueue port for exactly that reason — PROMPT.md 6.2, this package must
// not be a dependency of usecase/order just to write one row).

	// order through GET /partner/orders).

// implementation (adapter/webhook.Publisher); a future KafkaPublisher
// would be a new file, not a rewrite of this package.
