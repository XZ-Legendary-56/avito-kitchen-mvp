// Package outbox delivers events already written to outbox_events by other
// use-cases (order.created, order.cancelled — enqueued by usecase/order in
// the same transaction as the business write that caused them). PROMPT.md
// 6.5 is explicit that this exists independently of any message broker: a
// broker would still need this same table in front of it, since neither
// Postgres+broker nor Postgres+HTTP can be written atomically in one
// transaction. Swapping the delivery mechanism later means writing one new
// EventPublisher, not touching how events get produced.
