// CheckoutLine is one line of a checkout attempt: a cart line plus the
// result of re-checking it against live menu data, right before the order
// is created (PROMPT.md 5.2's "hard" check — stock and price can drift
// between adding to cart and checking out, so the soft check made at
// add-to-cart time is not enough on its own).
//
// This is order's own plain data shape, not domain/catalog.MenuItem:
// domain/order must not import domain/catalog (PROMPT.md 6.2 keeps every
// domain package independent of the others, since catalog and order are
// two of the modules the architecture is explicitly written to be able to
// split into separate services later — see PROMPT.md 6.1). The use-case
// that assembles a []CheckoutLine already has both a cart line and a live
// catalog.MenuItem in hand; Err is exactly whatever
// catalog.MenuItem.EnsureAvailable / EnsurePriceUnchanged returned for that
// line, unchanged — this package inspects only its Code (a plain string,
// not a catalog type) to decide what to do, never redoing the check
// itself. That is also why UnitPriceMinor is passed in already resolved:
// by the time Checkout runs, "is the price still what the cart thinks"
// has already been answered by Err.

	// (same "Checkout never redoes a check itself" rule as everything else
	// on this type). RescueOfferID nil means this line has no rescue offer
	// at all. Otherwise RescueQuantity is how many of Quantity still get
	// the discount right now (0..Quantity — 0 is a legitimate, non-error
	// outcome: the offer's window is still open but its stock ran out,
	// PROMPT.md 5.5's own condition table says that just means "sold at
	// full price", not a conflict) at RescueUnitPriceMinor each; the
	// remaining Quantity-RescueQuantity units, if any, are priced at the
	// ordinary UnitPriceMinor. A caller that finds the offer's WINDOW
	// itself no longer valid reports that as Err (RESCUE_OFFER_EXPIRED)
	// instead of setting these — that case is a conflict, not a split.

// Checkout validates lines and, if every one of them is clean, builds a new
// Order in StatusCreated. It is all-or-nothing: any failure returns only an
// error, never a partially built Order.
//
// Note what Checkout deliberately does NOT check: the venue's minimum
// order amount. That check (catalog.Venue.EnsureMinOrderReached) needs the
// venue's data, which — same rule as above — this package cannot import.
// The checkout use-case runs it itself, on the total this function's
// result reports through Order.TotalMinor(), after Checkout succeeds.
//
// Failure priority when lines have different problems, worth stating
// explicitly because nothing about it is forced by the data itself: a
// price change is reported ahead of a stock shortage, because a stale
// price invalidates whatever total the customer already agreed to
// regardless of what else is wrong — there is no point also telling them
// about stock on an order they would reject anyway once they see the
// corrected total. Within stock problems, an item pulled from the menu
// entirely (ITEM_UNAVAILABLE) is reported ahead of one that simply has too
// little left (INSUFFICIENT_STOCK), mirroring the priority
// catalog.MenuItem.EnsureAvailable already uses for a single item. Every
// line sharing the winning problem is reported together, in Details — not
// just the first one found — so the client can fix its cart in one round
// trip instead of one item at a time.
