// CartItem is one line in a cart. ID identifies the line itself (what the
// public API's PATCH/DELETE /cart/items/{itemId} addresses) — separate from
// MenuItemID, since a menu item can only appear once per cart but the line
// referencing it still needs its own stable address. PriceMinorSnapshot is
// the price shown to the customer when the item was added (PROMPT.md 9:
// cart_items), compared against the live menu price at checkout so a
// change can be reported as PRICE_CHANGED instead of silently charging a
// different amount.
//
// RescueOfferID records which rescue offer (PROMPT.md 5.5), if any,
// PriceMinorSnapshot was based on when this line was last added to or
// updated — nil means the snapshot is the item's plain price. It exists so
// checkout can re-check that SPECIFIC offer's current state (still live?
// window ended? remaining shrunk?) rather than just asking "is there some
// active offer now", which could not tell a genuinely expired deal apart
// from one that never applied to begin with.

// stored stale), so the merged line must reflect that fresh resolution, not
// whatever was true when the earlier quantity was added. venueID must match
// the cart's pinned venue, or this returns CART_VENUE_MISMATCH.
